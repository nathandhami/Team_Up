In the 'Create Sports Event' tab, the Google Maps locates parks and not locations for sports.
Not all sports can be played in a park. Some parks might only have a soccer field and not a basketball court.

OR search up all the locations and input them manually, which is a very long process.
Otherwise, everything else is working as wanted.
