The page might take time to load, so if you get 502 bad gateway, maybe wait for a few minutes and then try to reload the page.

Google and Twitter authentication along with local authentication works. Everything else is work in progress.
In the 'Create Sports Event' tab, the google maps works, the buttons to select the sport works, and the form is still in progress.
As for the 'Edit Account', it will render a new page and the rest is work in progress.
